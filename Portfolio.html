	<h2>My Projects</h2>
	<p>I am excited to be halfway through my journey to become an Associate Software Engineer. I applied and was accepted into the Dev.Build 4.0 class, where I will learn both front-end and back-end coding environments. So far I have learned to code using c#. 
	The two projects I enjoyed making so far have been the POS Terminal where I collaborated with a partner to create a program for a user to purchase items and pay for them. The other project I enjoyed mnaking was the Rock, Paper, Scissors game.
