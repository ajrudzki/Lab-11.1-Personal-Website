	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<img src="me.jpg" />
	<p>I was born on May 16th, 1984. I grew up in Wixom, MI and own a home in Redford, MI.</p>
	<p>I have lived in 2 states, Michigan and Arizona. I have traveled to 21 different states and the only other country I have been to outside of the US is Canada.</p>
	<p>Technology has always been an interest in my life. I have built and repaired computers since I was 13 years old. My first IT Career started out as a Desktop Technical Support Specialist for Quickenloans. Over time I have sharpened my skills in both the Windows and Macintosh Operating Systems.</p>
